This Python script creates a tool to scale down a PDF file. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

1. The script uses the PyPDF2 library to read and write PDF files.
2. The `scale_pdf` function takes an input PDF, scales each page by the given factor, and writes the result to an output file.
3. The `main` function handles command-line arguments and error checking.

To use this tool, you'll need to:

1. Install the PyPDF2 library using pip:
   ```
   pip install PyPDF2
   ```

2. Save the script to a file, e.g., `pdf_scaler.py`.

3. Run the script from the command line with the following syntax:
   ```
   python pdf_scaler.py <input_pdf> <output_pdf> <scale_factor>
   ```

   For example:
   ```
   python pdf_scaler.py input.pdf output.pdf 0.5
   ```

   This would scale the input PDF to 50% of its original size and save it as output.pdf.

The scale factor should be a number between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the original size and smaller numbers result in a more scaled-down PDF.

Would you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail?
